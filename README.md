# My Health Journal (project-2)

## Project Description

Caregivers can often find themselves overwhelmed keeping track of the health statistics of their loved ones. A parent caring for two or more children, keeping track of medications, temperatures and symptoms it's easy to get confused. The consequence of that confusion could be deadly if medications are given in excess. My health journal is a comprehensive application that allows caregivers to keep track of the vital statistics and given medication for multiple "patients" or loved ones.

The caregiver can enter the patients first and last name, age, height, weight, and daily medications to the patients profile. Then medications for ailments, medication dosage, time medication was administered, body temperature, time of body temperature recording, and symptoms are logged into the interactive calendar. These statistics are best logged when they are tracked twice a day, once in the morning and again in the evening. My health journal can track improvements in symptoms, and will flag if symptoms persist beyond what is expected and professional medical intervention is needed.

Patient information can be updated to the database as needed as patients grow and needs change. Primary physician & pharmacy contact information may also be logged into the database as perscription refills are needed or in case of emergency.

(Ice box) My health journal will also check medications to a database of harmful drug interactions to ensure that all medicaitons administered are safe to mix, and will flag any dangerous interactions.

## Installation
